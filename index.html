		<h2 class = "regular">Introduction</h2>
		<p class = "reg">The knowledge question that we have chosen to answer is “to what extent does language affect shared knowledge and associated areas of knowledge”. In order 
		to provide a complete response to this question, we will address all facets. Our answer will explore how language affects the ways of knowing (WOKs) in our RLS and will then 
		prove how these WOKs produce shared knowledge in our areas of knowledge (AOK), which are the human sciences and ethics. The next step in our process is to demonstrate how 
		language can alter perspectives and thus shared knowledge in the associated AOKs, using examples from our RLS. Finally, we will further prove that language influences the 
		AOKs and how these changes will affect shared knowledge. In essence, we will analyze the effects of language as a WOK and will determine how these changes translate into 
		shared knowledge and the AOKs in our RLS. </p>

		<h2 class = "regular">Jamal Khashoggi - The Person</h2>
		<p class = "reg">Jamal Ahmad Khashoggi was born into an extraordinarily powerful and famous family in Saudi Arabia. His cousin was Dodi Fayed, the boyfriend of Princess 
		Diana, and his uncle was a billionaire who played a role in the Iran-Contra scandal. He began his career in journalism as a correspondent for the Saudi Gazette and continued
		this pathway by becoming a reporter for various other Arab newspapers. At the height of his career, he became the deputy editor in chief of Arab News. Before his murder in 
		October 2, 2018, he exposed many scandals related to the Saudi government. Most notably, this included him hosting an objective television newscast for Al-Arab that aired 
		for 11 hours before being ordered by the government to be shut down. After leaving Saudi Arabia for Virginia in September 2017, Khashoggi became a columnist with the 
		Washington Post. In his very first column, he explained to his readers that he feared arrest in Saudi Arabia, so he had gone into self-imposed exile.</p>

		<h2 class = "regular">The Murder's Backstory</h2>
		<p class = "reg">On October 2, 2018, Jamal Khashoggi entered his country’s consulate in Istanbul to pick up official documents for his upcoming marriage. He had been 
		living in self-exile in the United States where he had been granted political asylum. He was often critical of the Saudi government,  by commenting on its foreign policy 
		and oppression of free speech, taking direct aim at Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. As a result, he had been pressured politically to leave Saudi Arabia, so 
		he had begun writing an opinion column for the Washington Post. After being granted asylum, Khashoggi had begun to build a network between Washington, Istanbul, 
		London and other world capitals.  He was planning to marry and resettle in Turkey with his fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, which was the reason for his visit to the consulate. </p>

		<h2 class = "regular">The Murder</h2>
		<p class = "reg">After entering around 1pm, he never came out of the consulate. The evidence of what happened, revealed gradually over the coming days and weeks of 
		investigations and leaks, would shock the world. His fiancee, Hatice Cengiz was in disbelief, saying "I didn't believe that Jamal had been killed until the official 
		statement was released by Saudi Arabia. Jamal didn't do anything to be killed for. He wasn't accused of anything. There was no case against him. He wasn't guilty of 
		any crime."</p>

		<h2 class = "regular">The Investigation into the Murder</h2>
		<p class = "reg">Evidence such as audio recordings, CCTV footage and forensic evidence all suggest that Khashoggi was killed by a hit squad (presumably hired by the 
		government) and then dismembered. The consulate was scrubbed clean and his body disposed of, with its whereabouts still unknown. A body double wearing the dead Khashoggi's 
		clothes was seen leaving the consulatulate, a sign of a meticulously planned operation.</p>

		<h2 class = "regular">Aftermath</h2>
		<p class = "reg">Kashoggi's brutal murder caused international outcry, which put immense pressure on the Saudi government as investigators and his loved ones probed for 
		answers. Those who knew Kashoggi advocated for his deep love for his country and his work to promote democracy in the Arab world - and with it, the "legacy of peace and 
		tolerance he left behind."</p>
