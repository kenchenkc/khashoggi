		<h2 class = "regular">Introduction</h2>
		<p class = "reg">To show how language can affect shared knowledge, it first must be proved that language has an effect on WOKs. This way, all possible effects of language 
		with respect to WOKs can be analyzed to demonstrate the resulting effects on the areas of knowledge and shared knowledge. </p>

		<h2 class = "regular">Language and Memory</h2>
		<p class = "reg">Language and memory are often linked in our RLS when producing knowledge in the human sciences and ethics. The first link is in Khashoggi’s writing. 
		Khashoggi wrote about many events that happened in the past and offered his insights on them. During his career with the Washington Post, he often criticized the Saudi 
		government and their past political decisions by using memory of news reports he saw or recalling information told to him by his sources. Many of his articles were driven 
		by ethics as an AOK because he regarded the corrupt and discriminatory actions of the Saudi government as intolerable. In one column, he wrote that Saudi Arabia “should 
		return to its pre-1979 climate, when the government restricted hard-line Wahhabi traditions.” It is evident that he used memory as a WOK here because he was referring to 
		past events, specifically Saudi Arabia’s “pre-1979 climate”. The shared knowledge created by Khashoggi’s use of memory and his articles with language caused huge disruptions 
		in the AOK of human sciences, specifically politics in Saudi Arabia, and ethics. With Khashoggi’s writing available to the general public, the Saudi government had to take 
		notice. The government and its staff relied on their memory to review Khashoggi’s long history of actions against the government such as publishing critiques of the Wahhabi 
		religious establishment. They also recalled their past barriers set against him, including banning him from Twitter and pressuring Al-Hayat to cancel his column. With this 
		shared knowledge created through memory, the Saudi government understood that Khashoggi was a threat to their political domination because of the knowledge he produced about 
		Saudi Arabian politics and their unethical actions. This whole reasoning process of the Saudi government, which in all likelihood led to Khashoggi’s death, was fueled by 
		Khashoggi’s powerful language. Language played another critical role here as well. If past events recalled via memory could not be expressed, such information would be 
		useless to the Saudi government. Thus, language is used as an identification system for memories and a communication method. For our RLS, this meant that the Saudi 
		government as well as Khashoggi used their language to convey their ideas and beliefs to others. Such actions produced shared knowledge in our AOKs.</p>

		<h2 class = "regular">Language and Reason</h2>
		<p class = "reg">Language was the main WOK used to express shared knowledge in our RLS. The different accounts of the “truth” were all expressed through media coverage of 
		what happened. Faith and emotion as WOKs were also used to generate knowledge in ethics and the human sciences, which were used in the decision making processes of the 
		parties involved.</p>

		parties involved.</p>
		<br>
		<p class = "reg">Meanwhile, those who didn’t believe the Saudi government’s story was true used sources like UN reporter Agnes Callamard’s reports. Callamard used 
		language as a WOK to turn her discoveries into shared knowledge for the world to see and add to their own personal knowledge, so they could form conclusions as to 
		what they believed could have happened. This lead some to form their own conclusions as to what really happened by using their imagination and reason as WOKs. Most 
		prominently however, Kashoggi’s loved ones would have used their emotions as a WOK when they distrusted what the Saudi government claimed had happened, since they would 
		want to confirm for themselves that the real culprits were brought to justice. Their emotions also contributed to the knowledge formed in their ethics as an AOK since 
		they were justifiably using ethical egoism by distrusting the government (who were supposed to be seen as leaders), who were known to be untrustworthy.</p>

		<h2 class = "regular">Conclusion</h2>
		<p class = "reg">So although the government’s accounts of Kashoggi’s murder were believed by some and mistrusted by others, faith, emotion, and most importantly, language 
		as WOKs were necessary to convey information in this RLS into shared knowledge. </p>
