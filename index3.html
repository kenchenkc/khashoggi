		<p class = "reg">Language as a WOK plays a huge role in altering people’s perspectives, and in our RLS the media and the Saudi government contribute conflicting viewpoints 
		on the situation, with Khashoggi’s writing also adding language to consider.</p>

		<h2 class = "regular">Perspectives on Khashoggi's writing</h2>
		<p class = "reg">In Khashoggi’s writing, he used language to convert his personal knowledge into shared knowledge which enabled him to convey his point of view to readers. 
		Khashoggi’s faith and emotions were also catalysts for his writing because many questionable actions of the Saudi government conflicted with Khashoggi’s own beliefs, which 
		fueled his emotions to write. Once readers have read Khashoggi’s writing, they can determine themselves whether or not their faith and emotions align with Khashoggi’s. In 
		this situation, it is crucial to highlight that all of Khashoggi’s readers have gained shared knowledge about Saudi politics and government ethics from his writing 
		regardless of their own standpoints. Those who agree with Khashoggi and support his writing probably have a similar faith and belief system as Khashoggi. Their emotion 
		would be ignited, and they would read more of Khashoggi’s articles. The additional shared knowledge of traditional religious hierarchies and ethics in Saudi Arabia would 
		be produced through Khashoggi’s writing. Another angle arises when Khashoggi’s readers do not support his point of view. This would mean that the faith and belief system 
		of these readers would be more aligned with the Saudi government. The emotions that these readers feel may be anger towards Khashoggi who dared question Saudi’s great system 
		of tradition and hierarchy. These readers would stop reading his articles altogether, missing out on additional shared knowledge in this scenario. </p>

		<h2 class = "regular">Perspectives on the Saudi Government</h2>
		<p class = "reg">In terms of everyone’s viewpoints on the Saudi government, their opinions will differ depending on their past experiences with the government’s actions. 
		Faith and memory as WOKs are used here with the language used by the government being important when determining someone’s opinions.</p>
		<br>
		<p class = "reg">For someone who agrees with the government, they must have had good past experiences with their decisions or have taken in the language their leaders use 
		and gained faith based on their memory. People who originally supported the government are likely to not change their support very easily, as politically one’s views tend 
		to align with one party and thus they will support said party. In order for the government to gain these supporters, the language they use must alter the shared knowledge 
		of citizens into believing they have the best policies and most adept decision making. In the case of a government supporter, their shared knowledge about this RLS will 
		likely be gained through language of the government rather than the media and Khashoggi’s writing, causing a disparity in shared knowledge between these people 
		and others.</p>
		<p class = "reg">Inversely, the same can be said about the view that the government is in the wrong. Citizens can be in full support of other parties and be critical of 
		the current governing party, or more likely have taken in the language used by the media and more neutral people. The media plays a big role in swaying public opinion and 
		educating people about the situation as the news is where nearly everyone obtains their information. In our society, the media is incredibly good at altering shared 
		knowledge, as we use the internet as our main source of it, where the media is dominant. However, that’s not to say the media is correct 100% of the time. Just like the 
		government, the media can be politically motivated to change or selectively choose information to include in their articles, limiting the amount of information available 
		with the intent of making the Saudi government look bad. In both cases, language is used to alter shared knowledge to a great extent.</p>

		<h2 class = "regular">Conclusion</h2>
		<p class = "reg">Language is an influential WOK is the fundamental aspect of building a perspective on a situation. Perspective and shared knowledge go hand in hand, with 
		perspective being the variable determining what type of shared knowledge is created.</p>
