		<h2 class = "regular">The Human Sciences and Ethics as AOKs</h2>
		<p class = "reg">	Khashoggi’s language, as well as the language used by the media and the Saudi government, influence the AOKs in our RLS in many ways. Beginning with 
		Ethics, shared knowledge is strongly tied to this AOK. As for normative ethics, the evaluation of one’s actions depends on language as a WOK in the sense that Khashoggi’s 
		words and expressions offer his perspective on the Saudi government. Using language, one can choose which ethical viewpoint to use when deciding the morality and correctness 
		of everyone’s actions in the scenario. Memory and faith as WOKs are also important as they influence what type of language you take in - for example, if you have strong 
		faith in the Saudi government you’ll be more likely to listen to them rather than the media. Reason and emotion also play a big role when creating a perspective since if 
		emotion overpowers reason your shared knowledge gained from language would be more limited and skewed.</p>
		<br>
		<p class = "reg">In this RLS specifically, the media was very critical of the Saudi government with an example being the publisher of Washington Post saying "The complete 
		lack of transparency and the Saudi government's refusal to co-operate with independent investigators suggests that this was merely a sham trial." as an example. Perspective 
		and shared knowledge play a major part in Ethics, and influencing these two aspects changes their evaluation of this RLS. In terms of moral realism and relativism, the 
		realist view wouldn’t be altered by language as judgements are absolute, but relativists are always open to language and cultural influence. Virtue ethics is the most 
		relevant ethical system here and allows people to judge someone’s actions based on if the individual themself is good or bad, allowing government supporters to immediately
		conclude that the government must’ve had a justifiable reason for the murder. Being influenced strongly by the language used by the government, the shared knowledge of the 
		supporters is different from those of more neutral people and supporters of other Saudi parties. People who are against the Saudi government wouldn’t even consider any 
		reasons for them to have been in the right, and are likely to take in language from their favoured party’s leaders and the media to alter their shared knowledge. The virtue 
		viewpoint of “the Saudi government is bad and corrupt and therefore they do bad things” is what they would use. To summarize, the perspective you have on the Saudi 
		government is indicative of the language you take in, as ethical relativism is highly dependent on shared knowledge. In a more broad view of ethics as an AOK, language 
		affects reason as WOKs, which combine with faith and memory as WOKs to formulate one’s perspective on morals in the RLS.</p>
		<br>
		<p class = "reg">As for Human Sciences as an AOK, since the murder was politically motivated, the language used by Khashoggi in his writing was very political and must 
		have changed the shared knowledge of the Saudi people to a large extent.  The government must’ve been in enough fear of Khashoggi’s language that they would have an 
		incentive to order the murder.  Understanding the politics aspect of this AOK allows us to gain further shared knowledge about the RLS.</p>

		<h2 class = "regular">Conclusion</h2>
		<p class = "reg">In our RLS, the different ways of knowing (WOK) are made apparent when we look at this scenario through the perspective of outside investigators and 
		journalists and the Saudi government. While we are examining how the use of language affects one's shared knowledge with our knowledge question, the WOK of reason, 
		imagination, and memory also play a significant role in the examination of this real life situation.  </p>
		<br>
		<p class = "reg">The use of language as a WOK is seen most in the area of knowledge (AOK) of the Human Sciences. Because of the nature of this murder, I will look 
		specifically into politics as a Human Science through the perspective of the Saudi government. The connection between the two parties, Jamal Khashoggi and the Saudi 
		government, was first made on a political stance. Politics is a human science that not only handles situations of human behaviour but is also very important in creating 
		relationships between different ideologies and countries. In a column from the Washington Post, Khashoggi states that “fear, intimidation, arrests and public shaming of 
		intellectuals and religious leaders who dare to speak their minds” is very common in Saudi Arabia which made it unbearable for him to remain there. While the use of 
		language can positively affect shared knowledge by making more knowledge accessible to more people, it can also do the reverse and stop people from receiving knowledge. 
		Public shaming of religious and intellectual leaders causes shared knowledge to become fairly limited in the political sphere of Saudi Arabia. Jamal Khashoggi saw this 
		suppression of knowledge and took it upon himself to speak out about the government. Once he moved to the United States, Khashoggi started using his language and personal 
		knowledge of the Saudi Arbian culture to share the truth about what the Saudi government does to the spread of knowledge. Since the Saudi government has no political power 
		in the United States to stop this spread of knowledge they waited for him to arrive at the Saudi consulate in Turkey where they proceeded to assassinate him. So, in the 
		perspective of the Saudi government, language is a tool used to push their ideologies while suppressing others in the political landscape so that they can control the shared 
		knowledge in their atmosphere. </p>
		<br>
		<p class = "reg">While the use of language in Saudi Arabia has more to do with keeping different ideologies from surfacing and changing shared knowledge, outside 
		investigators and journalists do not have those restrictions. Outside investigators are free to use language to spread the word about the death of Jamal Khashoggi. 
		They can learn and grow from the shared knowledge presented to them by others in their field to find the truth about what really happened with Khashoggi. Khashoggi himself 
		went into self exile to speak out about why Saudi Arabia had become more repressive with the new Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in power. Reporting the truth about the 
		assassination became crucial for the world to see what the Saudi government is willing an able to do. Turkish reporters and reporters from the UN were investigating the most 
		about the death of Jamal Khashoggi. Turkish reporters and officials said that before Khashoggi had entered the Saudi Consulate, there had been a group of 15 Saudi agents 
		that had removed the security cameras and the surveillance footage. Not having proper surveillance and footage of the scene highly impacts the extent to which we know what 
		happened to Khashoggi. While this act impacted the language we have about the assassination, reason as a way of knowing can help us determine that their should be a link
		between Saudi Arabia and the death of Khashoggi. And that’s what Agnes Callamard, a UN Special Rapporteur, had found out through their investigation. The Saudi government 
		confirmed the allegation almost a year after the assassination when most of the world already had suspected them because of these outside investigators. The use of language 
		to spread the evidence found of the murder is what helped people to already have a high suspicion of the Saudi government. For people outside of Saudi Arabia, this was 
		already in their shared knowledge.</p>
		<br>
		<p class = "reg">While language affected shared knowledge the most, the other ways of knowing are also important in their own right. Reason as a WOK was highly useful in 
		this RLS. For both parties, a good understanding of how the other parties would react is necessary to go about with what they are doing. For example, the Saudi government 
		has to know that people in their country are capable of using reason as a WOK to speak out about the death of Khashoggi and blame the Saudi government. Because of this, the 
		government needs to use their fear tactics to keep people in line and not question what is happening in the country. For the outside investigators, they need to use reason 
		as a WOK to fill in the gaps of knowledge they have about the murder. Since all security cameras and surveillance footage was taken down before Khashoggi entered the Saudi 
		consulate, the investigators need to use reason and memory to figure out what could have happened and what was most probable for the Saudi government to perform. Imagination is
		also needed to analyze the situation but is not a main WOK that would be used by these two perspectives. Imagination would be a useful WOK for those that did not have a good 
		sense of reason on the situation such as the general public.</p>
		<br>
		<p class = "reg">In conclusion, in these two perspectives, the ability to use or not use language affects shared knowledge. For the Saudi government, language is used by
		them to deter others from using their language and spreading their different perspectives. For the outside investigators, the ability to utilise language allows them to 
		further their ideas and share the truth about what happened with Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate.</p>
